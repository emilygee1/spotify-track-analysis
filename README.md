# Spotify Track Analysis
As a music lover, Spotify enthusiast, and data scientist, I wanted to do some exploration into this Spotify dataset of over 170,000 songs from 1921 to 2020. There is a mix of features about the tracks themselves and their audio qualities, such as artists, tempo, danceability, and loudness.

I conducted an exploratory analysis to see how the trends in music have changed over the last century and tried to predict whether or not a track is popular based on its audio characteristics.
